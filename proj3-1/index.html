		<h1>Part 1</h1>
		<p>For ray generation, we only need to get the ray's direction in world-space (since origin - camera pos - is already given). In order to do this, we need to map the point in imagespace to worldspace. This can be done by calculating the proportion of the distance the point is from the leftmost and bottommost x and y values respectively, and translating those proportions into the width and height defined by the images in worldspace. </p>
		<p>The triangle intersection algorithm I implemented used the Moller-Trombore algorithm. </p>
