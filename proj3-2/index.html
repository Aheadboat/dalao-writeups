        <h3 align=="middle">Overview</h3>
        <p>
            This project aims to further refine the pathtracer we created in part 1 to model different materials (mirrors, glass) and cameras. By the end of the project (and parts 1 and 4), I was able to properly model glasses and reflective surfaces, as well as simulate a camera in focusing and changing lens radius. 
            For this project, I implemented Parts 1 and 4. The approach I used towards Parts 1 and Parts 4 were very straightforward - I referenced the lecture slides whenever I encountered something I wasn't sure of. I encountered a "problem" in Part 1 where I was rendering all-black spheres, but after painstakingly searching for a bug for two hours, I realized I was using m=1!
        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 1. Mirror and Glass Materials</h3>
        <p>
            For this part, we implemented ideal mirrors and glass materials. Implementing mirrors relied heavily on the reflect function, in which we simply reversed the incoming rays' x and y directions. We used Snell's Law for glass materials to determine the wi direction after refraction.

            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            At m=0, we only have the area light (no bounce illumination). 
        </p>
        <p>
            At m=1, we can see the effects of one bounce illumination. Now the room is lit up by the area light and the spheres are lit up where the area light directly bounces off them. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At m=2, the spheres start to take on some light from the environment (walls), so they are no longer pitch black. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At m=3, the right sphere starts to take on more light from the room, and also lights the area below the sphere. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At m=4, we can see the right sphere's reflection within the left sphere is now lit up. We can also see the right sphere reflects light back onto the blue wall. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At m=5, the image has started converging. There is less noise around the reflection of the area light in the right sphere. In addition, the right sphere's reflection in the left sphere becomes more detailed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At m=100, the image has mostly converged and there aren't any new multibounce effects. The reflection of the right sphere has become clearer. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p><b>
            Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            The area under the right sphere gets lit up at m=3 because the light first bounces off the sphere, then the wall, then back under the sphere. 
        </p>

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <p><b>
            All the images generated before this part have used a 'pinhole' camera where everything was always in focus. The thin-lens camera model, which we implemented in this part, is more more in line with real-world applications like the way humans see and the way cameras work. 
            One big difference between a thin-lens camera and a pinhole camera is focal length. In the pinhole model, focal length is the distance between the aperture and the sensor, while in thin-lens, focal length is the distance at which parallel rays intersect.

            Show a "focus stack" where you focus at 4 visibly different depths through a scene.
