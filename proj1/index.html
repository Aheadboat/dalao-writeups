<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>We gained further insight into common computer graphic sampling techniques. We saw how different sampling methods affected image quality and performance.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
  
<p>We rasterize triangles by first creating a bounding box from the three vertices, then doing the three line test to determine if a point is inside or outside the triangle. Our algorithm is no worse than one that checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle because thats exactly what we do. </p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

  <p>Our supersampling algorithm involves dividing each pixel into sqrt(sample_rate) x sqrt(sample_rate) subpixels and sampling them. We then place these pixels into the sample buffer, which is resized by the sample rate (i.e. width * height * sample rate) in set_framebuffer_target, and then average all the associated sub-pixels into a single pixel in resolve_to_framebuffer. Supersampling by nature is an anti-aliasing technique, since it reduces artifacts and smoothens out rough edges by creating smoother transitions. In addition, it allows the inclusion of some pixels that might have been otherwise left out due to their exact centers not being within a triangle.</p>

<p>Made cubeman shrug his shoulders in the "it is what it is" pose. Had to rotate the arms to get the shoulder affect and further translate and rotate the forearms.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
  
  <p>Barycentric coordinates essentially tell where a point is located by reference to a simplex, i.e. a triangle in 2d space. If this triangle has vertices labeled A, B, C, then the respective values of a point's barycentric coordinates a, b and c will tell where that point is located respectively to the vertices. If a=1, b=0, c=0, then we know the point is on vertex A.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

<p>In pixel sampling we take the Barycentric coordinates for the point in the triangle and scale it by vectors of the <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> values in order to obtain a mapping onto the <i>uv</i> coordinates of the texture space. Since the <i>uv</i> coordinates are 0 to 1, we scaled it by the size of the texture. The issue, however, is that the coordinates do not map perfectly to each pixel of the texture so we must use nearest or bilinear sampling. Nearest sampling takes the closest pixel to the point, we did this by rounding our coordinates to the nearest integer. Bilinear sampling takes the closest four pixels to the point and performs linear interpolation between them. We found the closest pixels by taking the ceiling and the floor of the point and then we performed a 1D lerp horizontally and then another lerp vertically between the previous two lerps.</p>

        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling (16 samples per pixel)</figcaption>
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/bilinearsampling.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling (1 sample per pixel)</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/bilinearsampling16.png" align="middle" width="600px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling (16 samples per pixel)</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nearest sampling produced a more pixelated seeming image but sharper compared to bilinear sampling where the interpolation produced a smoother image but slightly blurrier seeming. This is apparent for instance in the white lines shown in the pixel inspector where it seems dashed with nearest sampling but more blended together with bilinear sampling. This difference is less apparent with the 16 pixels supersampling because when there are more, smaller pixels the inaccuracy of the mapping to the texture space is minimized and nearest sampling appears similarly clear.</p>


<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>

<p>The levels decrease in level of detail and in level sample we try to choose the level where we have close to one to one pixel movements. We implemented this by choosing a level using the formula where <i>du/dx, dv/dx, du/dy, dv/dy</i> are calculated from the <i>uv</i> coordinate conversion of <i>(x,y), (x+1,y), (x,y+1)</i>, via their Barycentric coordinates: <img src="images/levelformula.png" align="left" width="400px"/> <br>For nearest level sampling we rounded the calculated level and for bilinear level sampling we took a lerp between the results of bilinear sampling on the levels above and below.</p>
<p>Supersampling has the most powerful and precise antialiasing but at the cost of speed because we have to rasterize more pixels and memory because we have to resize the sample buffer to accomodate the additional pixels. Level sampling has the benefit of speed and precision because the mipmaps are already created but requires additional memory to store the mipmaps. Pixel sampling is fast and does not require any extra memory because it does not sample any extra pixels but has less powerful antialiasing because of how it approximates - nearest sampling can often miss the mark on pixels and bilinear sampling can have a bit of a blur effect because of how it blends the nearby points. </p>
